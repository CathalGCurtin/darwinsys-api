<p.
This is meant to provide a framework for
Java programs that want to provide
chaining of various filters, or any other
example where you want to move items between
an inactive list and an active list.
It does some neat things, including balancing
the widths of the two JLists.

<li><a href="MyListModel.java">MyListModel.java, the data model for the JList</a></li>
<li><a href="MyFilter.java">MyFilter.java, simple Filter interface</a>
(not really needed, could be any Object subclass with a concise toString())</li>
<li><a href="MyFilterException.java">MyFilterException.java</a>, trivial Exception subclass</li>
</ul>
