DarwinSys-API
=============

This is a collection of Java classes that I've found useful.
In most cases "found useful" means used more than once,
but not always. This codebase has been together for years,
and has somewhat grown like topsy, so lopsy may be lopping
off some of its leaves as time goes by. He will try to avoid
breaking any of the projects that uses it; if he does so, please
get in touch in the usual way(s).

Cheers

Ian Darwin
