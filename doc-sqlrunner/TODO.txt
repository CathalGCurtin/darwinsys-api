There's obviously lots still to do:

Medium items:
- GUI version should have gui for creating/editing .db.properties.
- Figure out if Cancel button can be made to work.
= UI to run external script file

Several items from JFuerth at SQLPower, who are using it in their Architect:

Command history is definitely a useful feature that we should have
soon, but I think the following are even more important:

1. Showing the results of a select statement in a JTable whose columns
are automatically sized to be just large enough to contain the largest
data in a column.  This should also be the default output format. The
columns should be sortable by clicking on the headers; I think the
canonical code from the 'net that provides this feature on JTable is
already in the Architect codebase somewhere.

2. For other types of statements that don't return tabular data,
showing the number of rows affected, and the execution time.  This
(along with item number 1) is what DBVisualizer does, and it's really
useful.

3. The ability to limit the number of rows fetched from the database.
The default limit could be 500 or something.

4. A "select all rows..." action on the popup menu for SQLTable
objects in the DBTree.  It would bring up a SQLRunner window and do
the obvious thing.

5. Finish implementation of "applciation plugin" by providing set/get ErrorHandler
to allow an application to provide its own error handler, and set/get ConnectionFactory
to provide Connections. This will make SQLRunner easier to embed seamlessly into
other applications.
